Hello, IÂ´m changing this file

So this web page is structured withe the head and the body
Inside the head we can see 2 tags:
    meta: use the name attribute to define a description,keywords, and author of an HTML. 
        Also define the viewport to control the page dimensions and scalling for different diveces
        
    link: this is a link, if you click it it will carry you to another page
    
Now with the head:
    center: to center align text 
    table: to create a table 
        Inside the table we have tbody
            this is to give a shape to the table
             Within the tbody we have tr that is for separate in the table.
